## Hi there, I'm Rakesh Poduval <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I am seasoned data scientist passionate about unraveling the intricacies of statistics and data science challenges. My coding expertise revolves around R and SQL, with occasional forays into Python.

🌱 Currently, I'm delving into advanced techniques to optimize Docker containers, specifically for R and Python-based applications such as predictive models and Shiny apps. Pursuing efficiency in containerization is a key focus in my ongoing learning journey.

💞️ Open to collaboration, I am eager to contribute my skills to meaningful data science projects. If you're looking for a dedicated professional who adds tangible value to your team, let's connect and explore opportunities to create impactful solutions together!

Here are a few things I truly enjoy:
* Crafting interactive dashboards using `RShiny`
* Exploring data, creating compelling visualizations, and building machine learning models
* Seamlessly integrating `R` and `Python` into production systems
