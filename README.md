- 👋 Hi there, I’m Rakesh Poduval, a professional data science manager. 
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics & data science challenges. I mainly write code with R & SQL, occasionally I do Python.
- 🌱 I’m learning techniques to optimize docker containers with R and Python-based applications - predictive models, shiny apps, etc.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects where I can add some value.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: poduval.rakesh@icloud.com
